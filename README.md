# üåç East Africa Digital Connectivity
**Tracking Mobile & Internet Growth Across East Africa**

---

## Project Description
East Africa Digital Connectivity explores how access to mobile and internet services has evolved across East African countries from 2000‚Äì2023. Using publicly available World Bank and ITU datasets, the project analyzes adoption trends, regional disparities, and growth patterns, and examines how digital connectivity correlates with socioeconomic factors such as GDP per capita and urbanization.

Through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and interactive visualizations in Streamlit, the project provides a clear picture of how digital infrastructure is expanding ‚Äî and which countries are leading or lagging.

## Problem Statement
Digital connectivity is a critical driver of economic growth, innovation, and social inclusion. While East Africa has experienced rapid mobile and internet penetration over the last two decades, progress is uneven across countries and regions.

Many rural and low-income populations remain underserved due to gaps in infrastructure, affordability, and digital literacy. Without a clear understanding of these disparities, policymakers risk making decisions that leave vulnerable communities behind.

This project addresses the gap by leveraging open data to:
- Identify **trends** in mobile and internet adoption.
- Highlight **regional leaders and laggards**.
- Provide **data-driven recommendations** for inclusive digital development.

## Research Questions
1. **RQ1:** How have mobile subscriptions and internet usage evolved over time in East Africa?
2. **RQ2:** Which East African countries have the highest and lowest internet penetration in the latest year?
3. **RQ3:** What is the relationship between GDP per capita, urbanization, and internet usage?
4. **RQ4:** What is the share of total East African mobile subscriptions by country?
5. **RQ5:** How does the variability of mobile subscriptions differ across countries over the last 10 years?
6. **RQ6:** How has fixed broadband adoption grown compared to mobile internet?
7. **RQ7:** What is the distribution of GDP growth rates in East Africa over the years?
8. **RQ8:** How does internet penetration vary geographically across East Africa?
